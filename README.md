# COVID-19 Dashboard
Analysis of COVID-19 Cases, Deaths, and Vaccination Rates Based on 2016 Election Vote

This python file creates a dashboard using Dash allowing the user to view daily and monthly rates. File is connected to CDC COVID-19 case, death, and vaccination data so will be up to date when re-run.

This analysis does not imply causation between vote in the 2016 election and COVID-19 rates. Due to the vast area of the United States, waves of the Coronavirus are bound to hit different areas at different times. Another confounding variable of this analysis is the number of urban centers within states. The 2016 election was chosen as a basis for this analysis because the 2020 election occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.
