# COVID-19 Dashboard
Analysis of COVID-19 Cases, Deaths, and Vaccination Rates Based on Election Vote and Urban Population Size

This python file creates a dashboard using Dash allowing the user to view daily and monthly rates. File is connected to CDC COVID-19 case, death, and vaccination data so will be up to date when re-run.

This analysis does not imply causation between vote in the 2016 election and COVID-19 rates. Due to the vast area of the United States, waves of the Coronavirus are bound to hit different areas at different times. The 2016 election was chosen as a basis for the political aspect of this analysis because the 2020 election occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2010 Census was chosen as the basis for determining urban areas of states as this is the most recent complete census (will be updated upon release of 2020 census).
